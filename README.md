# Futils

> A collection of (modern) C++ utilities and a Game Engine.

## Utils

Futils is a namespace containing numerous tools that I built over time depending on my needs.

You will find in the tests directory all the necessary tests to check the well-being of these utils. 

## Projects / Fender

> A Game Engine that can be used with several libraries.

Fender is a Work In Progress. Its a game engine in C++, relying on most utils found in this repository.
Its developed for a School Project but will probably be used for indie-games.
It supports only the SFML for now, but it's only a matter of time before jumping to 3d!
