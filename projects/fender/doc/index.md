## Where to start ? (WIP)

It might seem a bit complicated getting started with Fender. It's actually quite simple.

## ECS
> [Learn more !](./ecs.md)

Fender is based on an ECS, not the best performance choice but the most modular. Its fun to use, and fairly easy. 

For better readability, a system will be noted [SystemName] and a component will be noted (ComponentName). Entities being collections of Components, we'll simply call them by a their name.
