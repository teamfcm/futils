# Fender Documentation

> Fender is a general purpose game engine in C++

For better readability, a system will be noted [SystemName] and a component will be noted (ComponentName). Entities being collections of Components, we'll simply call them by a their name.

If you see {Trinity} it actually means there is an Entity with that name, as well as a Component and a System. For example, {Camera} means there is an Entity, a component and a system with the name Camera.

## How does it work ?

Fender is a huge project. If you want to know how it works, i'd recommend [starting here](./Fender).

## ECS
> [Learn more !](./ecs.md)

Fender is based on an ECS, not the best performance choice but the most modular. Its fun to use, and fairly easy.
