# Futils and Fender Documentation

> This documentation explains both the Futils C++ set of utilities 
> and the Fender C++ Rendering Engine. **Please** do contact me for any reasons :)

## [Futils](futils/index.md)

Futils is a collection of utilities (Classes and Functions) with general purpose,
mostly aimed at making day to day code easier and factored.

## [Fender](fender/index.md)

The Fender Engine is an Abstract Rendering Engine allowing you to concern yourself
with *only* the essentials. It is not an optimal engine, rather a fast prototyping
and complete tool. It should be possible to use different libraries from **NCurses** to **SFML**, **QT** or **Ogre3d**.
The code is abstract enough for you to easily switch libraries.

> Fender is ambitious and I will never actually be satisfied with the product.
It is a work in **constant progress**.
